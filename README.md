# TextSmith
### Distraction free book/paper editor

The project is currenetly only available for the windows platform because I am lazy, my mac is very old, and the source needs Qt v6.3. Sorry but speech ...

TextSmith's main goals are the create a distraction free editing experience.  Looking around, it seems that every program seeking to help a writer write, is actuall full of little bells and whistles giving the writer an excuse to play around to get the look just right.  Well, not this program, the only bells and whistles ihas are:

1. Cut/Copy/Paste
2. Undo/Redo
3. Bold/Italic/Underline
4. Indent/Undent
5. Search/Replace
6. Document Structure Tree w/tags
7. Word Count
8. Export to Common formats
9. Full screen editing
10. Optional typewriter sounds in full screen
11. Read aloud

I hope you enjoy it!
